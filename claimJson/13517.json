Annies List claimed that even though men are only forty-nine percent of the population, they hold eighty percent of the lawmaking power, which is one hundred and forty-four out of one hundred and eighty-one seats. It's such a huge gender disparity in representation."

I mean, I knew politics was male-dominated, but those specific numbers for the Texas Legislature really highlight the imbalance. Is that just how it's always been?"

But while the statistics about men comprising forty-nine percent of the population but holding eighty percent of lawmaking power in the Texas Legislature are striking, I'd want to understand the historical context and trends to see if this disparity has been increasing or decreasing over time. It's a significant imbalance, for sure."
